                        Service.</div>
                    <p class="small">The Service provides automated screening and ranking suggestions for resumes and
                        candidate profiles using natural language processing (NLP). It produces similarity scores,
                        relevance rankings, and shortlists to help human reviewers. The Service relies on Sentence-BERT
                        (SBERT) embeddings and additional algorithms to encode resume and job description text.</p>

                    <div class="section-meta">What we collect, why, and how long we retain it.</div>
                    <p class="small"><strong>Data collected:</strong> resumes, CV text, cover letters, job descriptions,
                        metadata (timestamps, uploader identity, annotations), and usage logs. Where provided, candidate
                        contact details and attachments may be stored to support recruitment workflows.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>Purpose:</strong> to compute SBERT embeddings, perform semantic matching,
                        rank candidates, and generate shortlists for human review. We may also use anonymized/aggregated
                        data to improve the Service and for research and analytics.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain personal data only as long as necessary for
                        the purposes described or to comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion; see
                        Section 7.</p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>Security:</strong> We apply industry-standard technical and organizational
                        measures (encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, logging) to protect data. However,
                        no system is perfectly secure — see Section 6 for limits on liability.</p>

                    <div class="section-meta">How SBERT is used and limitations of automated outputs.</div>
                    <p class="small">The Service encodes text (resumes, job descriptions) into dense vector
                        representations using SBERT (Sentence-BERT) or compatible embedding models. Similarity and
                        ranking are computed over those vectors and combined with configurable business rules (keywords,
                        thresholds, custom weights).</p>
                    <p class="small">Automated scores are probabilistic signals — they are not definitive measures of
                        candidate quality. Absolute accuracy depends on the quality of input data, model version, and
                        configuration. We recommend human review of all shortlists before interview or hiring decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small"><strong>Versioning:</strong> We may update or replace the embedding model (SBERT
                        variant) over time. Model version and training data (where applicable) may affect results.
                        Changes will be documented in our release notes and through the admin dashboard.</p>

                    <div class="section-meta">Our commitment and candidate protections.</div>
                    <p class="small">Automated NLP models can reflect or amplify biases present in training data. We
                        strive to detect and mitigate biased behaviors (through preprocessing, balanced datasets,
                        calibration, and manual audits). Nevertheless, the Service cannot guarantee bias-free outputs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">Users must ensure compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws and internal
                        policies when using the Service. The Service provides tools and settings (e.g., anonymization,
                        attribute filtering) to reduce bias risk, but final responsibility for fair hiring decisions
                        rests with the human users and the organization using the Service.</p>

                    <p class="small"><strong>Automated decision-making:</strong> If a final decision is made solely by
                        automated means that produces legal or similarly significant effects, eligible individuals may
                        have rights to obtain human intervention, express their point of view, and contest the decision.
                        We design the Service to support human-in-the-loop review to avoid solely automated adverse
