    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our platform, <strong>Intelligent Resume Screening and Shortlisting using NLP (SBERT)</strong> (the “Service”), collects, uses, and protects personal data of users, recruiters, and candidates. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect both personal and non-personal information necessary to operate and improve our intelligent resume screening system. The types of data collected include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Candidate Data:</strong> Resumes, cover letters, job descriptions, skill lists, and career summaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Email addresses, names, organization details, and account credentials when applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>System Data:</strong> Log files, browser type, device identifiers, IP addresses, and timestamps for auditing and security purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Interaction history, search queries, and feedback related to the performance of the NLP model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We use collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To perform NLP-based analysis and generate embeddings using <strong>Sentence-BERT (SBERT)</strong> for resume–job matching.</li>
      <li>To improve our algorithms, performance accuracy, and model fairness through anonymous data aggregation.</li>
      <li>To provide customer support, account management, and technical updates.</li>
      <li>To maintain security, prevent fraud, and comply with legal or contractual obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use SBERT and NLP Models</h2>
    <p>Our Service uses <strong>Sentence-BERT (SBERT)</strong> to convert textual data (resumes, job descriptions) into vector embeddings. These embeddings are compared to identify the semantic similarity between candidate profiles and job requirements. All processing is automated but designed to assist human recruiters — not to replace them. The final hiring decisions should always involve human review to ensure fairness.</p>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, we process personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consent provided by the user or candidate.</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests pursued by recruiters or employers using our platform.</li>
      <li>Compliance with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., employment, data protection).</li>
      <li>Performance of a contract between the user and our organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When data is no longer required, it will be deleted or anonymized. Backup data may persist for up to 90 days before being permanently erased.</p>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Our website may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience and gather analytics. Cookies help us remember preferences, measure performance, and personalize content. You can modify your browser settings to reject cookies, but some features of the Service may not function properly if cookies are disabled.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement advanced technical and organizational measures, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption of data during transmission and storage.</li>
      <li>Role-based access control for sensitive data.</li>
      <li>Regular system audits and vulnerability assessments.</li>
      <li>Secure cloud infrastructure compliant with global standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite these measures, no system can guarantee absolute security. Users are encouraged to use strong passwords and avoid sharing credentials.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may partner with trusted third parties for hosting, analytics, and email delivery. These providers are bound by confidentiality and data protection agreements. We do not sell or rent personal data to advertisers or other unrelated entities.</p>

    <h2>9. Fairness, Bias, and Ethical AI</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that our SBERT-based algorithms operate fairly and without discrimination. Our models undergo regular bias testing and validation to reduce unintended bias. Nonetheless, automated predictions should be reviewed by human recruiters before final decisions are made.</p>

    <h2>10. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li>Request a portable copy of your data (data portability).</li>
      <li>File a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests can be submitted via <a href=\"mailto:privacy@example.com\">privacy@example.com</a>. We aim to respond within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If such data is discovered, it will be deleted immediately upon verification.</p>

    <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed on servers located outside your country of residence. We ensure adequate protection measures in compliance with international data transfer regulations (e.g., GDPR, Standard Contractual Clauses).</p>

    <h2>13. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this policy periodically to reflect updates in technology, law, or operational practices. Significant changes will be communicated through notices on our website or via email. Please review this page regularly for the latest version.</p>
